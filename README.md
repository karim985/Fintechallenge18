## Project 18 Challenge

## PyChain Ledger 

I was recently promoted to act as the lead developer on my bank's decentralized finance team. my task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

# Installation

this chalenge requires the following programs :

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics)
[python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation)

# Usage 

**steps to run the project

**Step 1** : 

The folowing libraries are required to successfully lunch this project

- `import streamlit as st`
- `from dataclasses import dataclass`
- `from typing import Any, List`
- `import datetime as datetime`
- `import pandas as pd`
- `import hashlib`

**Step 2** :

In the terminal, navigate to the project folder.

In the terminal, run the Streamlit application byusing `streamlit run pychain.py`.

Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the "Add Block" button.

Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu.

Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface.
